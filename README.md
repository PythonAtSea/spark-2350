## What is this?

The spark!2350 is a RP2350 based microcontroller that has a RM2 chip for BLE and WiFi. It also has a LiPo battery charger, as it is designed for use in mireless keyboards. It also has a user accesable NeoPixel, and a variable charge rate. 

## Why?

I saw the release of the RM2 and I immediatly knew I wanted to make something with it. I've always thought the nice!nano was cool, so I kinda made that, although this is designed for maximum GPIO availibility, not small size.
